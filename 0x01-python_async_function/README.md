## Description

In this assignment, we will explore the concepts of asynchronous programming in Python. We will learn how to write asynchronous code using coroutines, `async` and `await` keywords, and the `asyncio` library and how to use the random module

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- The `asyncio` library
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zee-ham-su/alx-backend-python.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 0x01-python-async
    ```

3. Run the desired Python file:

    ```bash
    python3 file_name.py
    ```
