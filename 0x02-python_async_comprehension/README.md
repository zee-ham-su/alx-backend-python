# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

This project covers the topic of async comprehension in Python. Async comprehension is a powerful feature that allows you to create asynchronous generators and collect their results in a concise and efficient manner.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept of async comprehension
- Use async comprehension to create asynchronous generators
- Collect and process the results of async comprehensions
- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators

## Requirements

To complete the exercises and tasks in this project, you will need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An understanding of Python generators and coroutines
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `0-async_generator.py`: Implementation of an asynchronous generator using async comprehension.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Example usage of async comprehension to collect and process data asynchronously.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Script to measure the runtime of async comprehensions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/zee-ham-su/alx-backend-python.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd 0x02-python-async-comprehension`
3. Run the scripts or modify them as needed.
