# 0x03 - Unittests and Integration Tests

This directory contains the code and documentation for the 0x03 - Unittests and Integration Tests project.

## Description

In this project, we will be implementing unit tests and integration tests for our Python code. Unit tests are used to test individual units or components of our code in isolation, while integration tests are used to test the interaction between different components of our code.


## Resources:
- [unittest — Unit testing framework](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/a_AEObGK8jeqPtTPmm-gIA)
- [unittest.mock — mock object library](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/PKetnACd7FfRiU8_kpe5EA)
- [How to mock a readonly property with mock?](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/2ueVPK1kWZuz525FvZ1v2Q)
- [parameterized](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/mI7qc3Y42aZ7GTlLXDxgEg)
- [Memoization] (https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/x83Hdr54q4Vax5xQ2Z3HSA)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- The difference between unit and integration tests.
- Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures


## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
